# Geometric Brownian Motion Stock Simulator 📈

A quantitative finance tool that uses **Monte Carlo simulations** to predict future stock price paths based on historical volatility and drift. Built with Python.

## 🚀 Overview
This project applies the **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** model—the mathematical foundation of the Black-Scholes equation—to real-time financial data. It allows users to:
- Fetch live data for any stock/index (default: NIFTY 50).
- Simulate 100+ potential future price paths over 1 year.
- Calculate key risk metrics like **Value at Risk (VaR)** and expected returns.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core logic.
- **yfinance**: Real-time market data API.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Vectorized financial calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of simulation paths.
